# AMEX-Credit-Card-Default-Prediction
Credit cards are a common financial offering from traditional banks, but these institutions often hesitate to issue them to individuals likely to default on their payments. To mitigate this risk, banks collect and evaluate customer information to determine the potential for default.
It is common in the financial industry to build predictive models for credit card default based on various methods including machine learning techniques. Researchers have used predictors like income, job, residence, and credit situation using machine learning techniques like gradient boosting, support vector machines and random forest to predict the customers with a higher probability of default (Sayjadah et al., 2018). Another study utilized the logistic regression to model the impact immigration status has on the likelihood of the default where the results showed that the probability of default at a higher income level, immigrants were less likely to default while at the lower income level the probability of default was much higher (Chengan, 2018).
This report aims to build upon the current literature of employing the powerful generalized linear model framework and explore that what are the key predictors of credit card default among American Express customers, and how does the interaction between demographic factors impact the likelihood of default?
